### Keras Code Generation Model Example

This repository demonstrates a code generation model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks implemented with the **Keras** library and **TensorFlow** backend. The primary objective is to generate text sequences based on an input text.

#### Model Overview

The core of the model architecture lies in its use of an **LSTM layer**, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning patterns and dependencies in sequential data. The model is sequential, with an **LSTM layer** followed by a **Dense layer**. The **LSTM layer** processes input sequences, capturing contextual information, while the **Dense layer** outputs probabilities for the next character in the sequence using a softmax activation function.

#### Training Process

The training data is generated by sliding a window of fixed length (`max_len`) through the input text, creating input-output pairs. Each character is **one-hot encoded**, converting it into a binary format suitable for neural network training. The model is trained using the **Adam optimizer** and **categorical crossentropy** loss, aiming to minimize the difference between predicted and actual characters.

#### Text Generation

The `generate_text` function utilizes the trained model to generate text sequences. Starting with a seed text, the function iteratively predicts the next characters in the sequence. This process continues, progressively expanding the generated text based on the model's learned patterns.

#### Experimentation

Users are encouraged to experiment with different hyperparameters, such as `max_len` and training epochs, to observe how they influence the generated sequences. Additionally, varying the seed text provides insights into the model's ability to create diverse and contextually relevant code snippets.
